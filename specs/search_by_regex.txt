Tool: search_by_regex
=====================

Purpose
-------
Search the contents of files under a given path using a regular expression.
Powered by python_ripgrep (Python bindings for ripgrep) — no shell subprocess.

Parameters
----------
pattern  (required, string)
    The regular expression to search for.
    Restrictions (enforced by ripgrep's regex engine):
      - Must be linear-time: no backreferences (e.g. \1), no atomic groups.
      - No lookahead  (?=...) / (?!...)
      - No lookbehind (?<=...) / (?<!...)
      - No lookaround of any kind.
    Standard features allowed: character classes, alternation, quantifiers,
    anchors, non-capturing groups (?:...), Unicode categories.

path  (optional, string)
    File or directory to search.
    Accepts relative paths (resolved from os.getcwd()) or absolute paths.
    When omitted, defaults to os.getcwd().
    If a file path is given, only that file is searched.
    If a directory path is given, all files under it are searched recursively
    (ripgrep's default behaviour, respecting .gitignore).

Output Format
-------------
Results are grouped by file. For each file that contains at least one match:

  <file_path>:
    <line_number>:
    <line_with_bold_matches>

Rules:
  - <file_path> is printed followed immediately by a colon and newline.
  - Each match within that file is printed as a two-line block, indented by
    two spaces:
      Line 1:  "  <line_number>:"
      Line 2:  "  <rendered_line>"
    where <rendered_line> is the full text of the matched line with every
    occurrence of the matched substring wrapped in ANSI bold escape codes:
        \033[1m<matched_text>\033[0m
    The rest of the line is plain text.
  - Multiple matches in the same file are listed consecutively under the same
    file-path header (no blank line between them within a file).
  - A blank line separates consecutive file blocks.
  - If the pattern matches nothing anywhere, return the string:
        "No matches found."
  - If the path does not exist, return an error string beginning with "Error:".
  - If the regex is rejected by ripgrep (e.g. unsupported syntax), return an
    error string beginning with "Error:" that includes the library's message.

Example Output
--------------
Given pattern "foo" searching a directory:

    src/bar.py:
      12:
      result = \033[1mfoo\033[0m(x)
      45:
      # calls \033[1mfoo\033[0m here

    tests/test_bar.py:
      7:
      def test_\033[1mfoo\033[0m():

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Import as: from python_ripgrep import search
- Call with: heading=True, line_number=True so results are grouped per file.
- Each element of the returned list has the form:
      "<file_path>\n<lineno>:<line_text>\n<lineno>:<line_text>\n..."
- After retrieving raw lines from python_ripgrep, apply Python's re module to
  find match spans and insert ANSI codes — python_ripgrep does not return
  span information.
- The tool has no session_memory / project_memory target; it always returns
  the formatted string directly (return_value only).
- Add python-ripgrep to requirements.txt.
